### Hi there 👋

### TL;DR: Building complex systems in ambiguous contexts. Physics mindset. Piano discipline. Always asking why. Building for passion, not noise.

## What I do

I work on complex systems where structure is missing, stakeholders are many,
and decisions have real operational, reputational, or economic consequences.

I tend to take end-to-end responsibility without relying on formal power,
connecting vision and delivery and making systems work under ambiguity.

I’m most effective when there’s no clear answer
and someone needs to decide.

## How I think and work

- I look for the *reason* behind things, not just the solution  
- I’m comfortable holding ambiguity and complexity  
- I connect ideas to execution  
- I build systems meant to last, not to impress

## Background

👨🏻‍🔬 Physics-trained mindset (formal studies, lasting way of thinking).  
🎹 Piano: discipline, structure, long-term practice.  
📚 Forever a student.

I think constantly.  
I sleep very little.  
I tend to go deep rather than wide — even when it looks like the opposite.

## Life, people, meaning

🔗 Married to Sara.  
If you know her, nothing else needs to be said.  
If you don’t, she’s the only person capable of stopping me.

👧🏻 Father of Chiara and Rachele.  
Fatherhood turned out to be the most totalizing experience of my life.
All the stories were true.

⛪️ I go to church every Sunday.
I believe change is more effective when it happens from the inside.
I’m an educator for a group of incredible young people,
working with them on Digital Pastoral projects.

## Technology & making things work

🤖 I automate literally everything I can — homes included —
often with a touch of AI and machine learning.

Bash, Swift, Python… as long as it’s not overly verbose.

Some repositories here are experiments,
some are tools,
some are unfinished systems.
That’s intentional: living systems evolve.

## Interests & signals

⛰ Mountains and photography (Nikon).  
🎧 I listen to almost everything: trap, rap (also French), classical, songwriters, pop, indie, podcasts.

🏀 Kobe first, then L.A. Lakers.  
⚽️ Juventus.  
Plus golf, skiing, F1, MotoGP, biathlon, athletics, snooker — yes, even PDC.

💸 Crypto, NFTs, and broader questions around how value is created and sustained.

🕸 Social person, not very social-media-oriented.

## In short

📈 At the core, I’m an entrepreneur and a system builder.

- Developer by passion  
- Former CEO of StayActive  
- Active across insurance, finance, healthcare, and cultural projects  
- Product Hunter (22k+ products tested)  
- **Forbes 30 Under 30 Italy**

🏖 I like the idea of paid vacations and extra salaries,
but I don’t like being dependent on anyone —
except Sara, Chiara, and Rachele.
