### Hi there 👋

**TL;DR: Building complex systems in ambiguous contexts. Physics mindset. Piano discipline. Always asking why. Building for passion, not noise.**

## What I do

I work on complex systems where structure is missing, stakeholders are many,  
and decisions have real operational, reputational, or economic consequences.

I tend to take end-to-end responsibility without relying on formal power,  
connecting vision and delivery and making systems work under ambiguity.

I’m most effective when there’s no clear answer  
and someone needs to decide.

## A concrete example

One of the systems I work on is a large-scale cultural event
involving public institutions, sponsors, volunteers,
and thousands of participants.

It operates in a non-hierarchical context,
with high variability, strong public exposure,
and real reputational and logistical risk.

My role is to hold vision and delivery together,
take responsibility where structure is missing,
and ensure the system works — year after year.

One of these systems is the Palio of Vigevano,
a historical cultural event with strong public exposure
and a complex ecosystem of stakeholders.

## How I think and work

- I look for the *reason* behind things, not just the solution
- I’m comfortable holding ambiguity and complexity
- I connect ideas to execution
- I build systems meant to last, not to impress

## Background

👨🏻‍🔬 Physics-trained mindset (formal studies, lasting way of thinking).  
🎹 Piano: discipline, structure, long-term practice.  
📚 Forever a student.

💭 I think constantly.
🌙 I sleep very little.
⛏ I tend to go deep rather than wide — even when it looks like the opposite.

## Life, people, meaning

🔗 Married to Sara.  
If you know her, nothing else needs to be said.  
If you don’t, she’s the only person capable of stopping me. 🛑

👧🏻👶 Father of Chiara and Rachele.  
Fatherhood turned out to be the most totalizing experience of my life.  
All the stories were true. 🌍

⛪️ I go to church every Sunday.  
I believe change is more effective when it happens from the inside.  
I’m an educator for a group of incredible young people,  
working with them on Digital Pastoral projects. 🌱💻

## Technology & making things work

🤖 I automate literally everything I can — homes included —  
often with a touch of AI and machine learning. 🏠

Bash, Swift, Python… as long as it’s not overly verbose. ✂️

Some repositories here are experiments,  
some are tools,  
some are unfinished systems.  
That’s intentional: living systems evolve. 🌿

## Interests & signals

⛰ Mountains and photography (Nikon). 📸  
🎧 I listen to almost everything: trap, rap (also French), classical, songwriters, pop, indie, podcasts.

🏀 Kobe first, then L.A. Lakers.  
⚽️ Juventus.  
Plus golf, skiing, F1, MotoGP, biathlon, athletics, snooker — yes, even PDC. 🎯

💸 Crypto, NFTs, and broader questions around how value is created and sustained.

🕸 Social person, not very social-media-oriented.

except Sara, Chiara, and Rachele. ❤️
