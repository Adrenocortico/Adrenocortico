### Hi there 👋

**TL;DR: Building complex systems in ambiguous contexts. Physics mindset. Piano discipline. Always asking why. Building for passion, not noise.**

## What I do

I work on complex systems where structure is missing, stakeholders are many,  
and decisions have real operational, reputational, or economic consequences.

I tend to take end-to-end responsibility without relying on formal power,  
connecting vision and delivery and making systems work under ambiguity.

I’m most effective when there’s no clear answer  
and someone needs to decide.

## How I think and work

- I look for the *reason* behind things, not just the solution
- I’m comfortable holding ambiguity and complexity
- I connect ideas to execution
- I build systems meant to last, not to impress

## Background

👨🏻‍🔬 Physics-trained mindset (formal studies, lasting way of thinking).  
🎹 Piano: discipline, structure, long-term practice.  
📚 Forever a student.

💭 I think constantly.
🌙 I sleep very little.
⛏ I tend to go deep rather than wide — even when it looks like the opposite.

## Life, people, meaning

🔗 Married to Sara.  
If you know her, nothing else needs to be said.  
If you don’t, she’s the only person capable of stopping me. 🛑

👧🏻👶 Father of Chiara and Rachele.  
Fatherhood turned out to be the most totalizing experience of my life.  
All the stories were true. 🌍

🏰 I’m deeply involved in the Palio of Vigevano,  
a large-scale historical and cultural event with strong public exposure.

It’s a living system made of public institutions, sponsors, volunteers,
and thousands of participants and visitors.
A non-hierarchical context where responsibility is real
and continuity matters year after year.

⛪️ I go to church every Sunday.  
I believe change is more effective when it happens from the inside.  
I’m an educator for a group of incredible young people,  
working with them on Digital Pastoral projects. 🌱💻

## Technology & making things work

🤖 I automate literally everything I can — homes included —  
often with a touch of AI and machine learning. 🏠

Bash, Swift, Python… as long as it’s not overly verbose. ✂️

Some repositories here are experiments,  
some are tools,  
some are unfinished systems.  
That’s intentional: living systems evolve. 🌿

## Interests & signals

⛰ Mountains and photography (Nikon). 📸  
🎧 I listen to almost everything: trap, rap (also French), classical, songwriters, pop, indie, podcasts.

🏀 Kobe first, then L.A. Lakers.  
⚽️ Juventus.  
Plus golf, skiing, F1, MotoGP, biathlon, athletics, snooker — yes, even PDC. 🎯

💸 Crypto, NFTs, and broader questions around how value is created and sustained.

🕸 Social person, not very social-media-oriented.

## In short 🧭

📈 At the core, I’m an entrepreneur and a system builder.

- 👨‍💻 Developer by passion  
- 🧠 Former CEO of StayActive  
- 🏦 Active across insurance, finance, healthcare, and cultural projects  
- 🧪 Product Hunter (22k+ products tested)  
- 🏆 Forbes Top 100 Under 30 Italy

🏖 I like the idea of paid vacations and extra salaries,  
but I don’t like being dependent on anyone —  
except Sara, Chiara, and Rachele. ❤️
