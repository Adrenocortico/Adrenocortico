### Hi there 👋

I work on complex systems in ambiguous, high-variability environments.

I take end-to-end responsibility where structure is missing, stakeholders are many,
and decisions have real operational, reputational, or economic consequences.
I’m most effective when there’s no clear answer and someone needs to decide.

My work spans software, insurance, finance, healthcare, and large-scale cultural projects.
I tend to operate without formal power, using vision, systems thinking, and delivery.

## What defines the way I work

- I look for the *reason* behind things, not just the solution  
- I’m comfortable holding complexity and ambiguity  
- I connect vision and execution  
- I build systems that keep working even when I step back

## Background & interests (less formal, more me)

👨🏻‍🔬 Physics (I studied it seriously; the mindset stayed with me).  
🎹 Piano.  
🖖🏻 Willful, intransigent, talkative — in the constructive sense.  
🔍 I’m obsessed with *why* things work (or don’t).  
💭 I think constantly.  
🛏 I sleep very little.  
📚 Forever a student.

⛰ I love mountains and photography (Nikon).  
🔁 Inventor of the *circular rhyme*.

## Life, faith, people

🔗 Married to Sara.  
If you know her, no explanation needed.  
If you don’t, she’s the only person capable of stopping me.

👧🏻 Thanks mostly to her, Chiara was born.  
Fatherhood turned out to be the most totalizing experience of my life.
All the stories were true. I was wrong to doubt.

⛪️ I go to church every Sunday.
I’d like to revolutionize the Church from the inside.
I’m an educator for a group of incredible young people, working on Digital Pastoral projects with them.

## Tech & making things work

🤖 I automate literally everything I can — homes included — often with a touch of AI/ML.  
Bash, Swift, Python… as long as it’s not too verbose.

📱 I currently have hundreds of apps on my iPhone, tens of thousands of photos, and thousands of videos.
Yes, I know. No, I’m not fixing it.

I still use Bitbucket for historical reasons.
My GitHub repos are a work in progress — like many living systems.

## Music, sport, randomness

🎧 I listen to everything: trap, rap (also French), classical, singer-songwriters, pop, indie, podcasts.

🏀 Kobe first, then L.A. Lakers.  
⚽️ Juventus.  
Plus golf, skiing, F1, MotoGP, biathlon, athletics, snooker… yes, even PDC.

💸 Crypto, NFTs, and the broader question of how value actually works.

🕸 Social person, not very social-media-oriented (Facebook since 2008, mostly unused).

## In short

📈 At the core, I’m an entrepreneur.

- Developer by passion  
- Former CEO of StayActive  
- Active in insurance, finance, and healthcare  
- I tend to reshape the systems I touch  
- Product Hunter (22k+ products tested)

🏖 I’d like a 13th and 14th salary and paid vacations,
but I don’t want to be dependent on anyone —
except Sara, Chiara, and Rachele.
